            In computer technology, a console can mean different things depending on the context. It usually means a combination of a display monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair, which allows a user to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system.
            A console screen is used for checking if there are any issues with an app before publishing it. This helps users of the app because they won't be getting a faulty or non-tested version, they'll be getting a perfected verison of the app. At least as perfect as it can get. 
            To open a console screen on a typical chrome tab, you must first use your mouse or trackpad to click right on the screen. Once you see the usual pop-up, select the 'Inspect'button. Here you will see many options, it might seem intimitading at first but all you have to do is navigate from your current location to the small tab that says 'Console.' And there  you go, your at the Console screen. 
            If you want to print anything on the COnsole screen you have to type 'console.log(--your text--);' And the text you wrote will appear on the screen.
